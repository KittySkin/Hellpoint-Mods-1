Some mods for Hellpoint. 

## How to install
To install BepInEx:
* Download the `BepInEx.Hellpoint` zip file from this repository
* Extract into your `Hellpoint` directory. It should extract directly into the folder, so you should see `Hellpoint\BepInEx\`, `Hellpoint\Mono\`, `Hellpoint\doorstop_config.ini` and `Hellpoint\winhttp.dll`. If it all extracted into a folder such as `Hellpoint\BepInEx.Hellpoint\...` then you did it incorrectly.

To install any given Mod:
* Download the `.dll` file from the Release folder for that mod
* Place into your `Hellpoint/BepInEx/plugins/` folder
